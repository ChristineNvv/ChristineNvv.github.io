            Death City is home to the famous Death Weapon Meister Academy, a 
            technical academy headed by the Shinigami‚ÄîLord Death himself. Its 
            mission: to raise "Death Scythes" for the Shinigami to wield against 
            the many evils of their fantastical world. These Death Scythes, 
            however, are not made from physical weapons; rather, they are born 
            from human hybrids who have the ability to transform their bodies 
            into Demon Weapons, and only after they have consumed the souls of 
            99 evil beings and one witch's soul.

            Mirai Kuriyama is the sole survivor of a clan of Spirit World 
            warriors with the power to employ their blood as weapons. 
            As such, Mirai is tasked with hunting down and killing 
            "youmu"‚Äîcreatures said to be the manifestation of negative human 
            emotions. One day, while deep in thought on the school roof, Mirai 
            comes across Akihito Kanbara, a rare half-breed of youmu in human 
            form. In a panicked state, she plunges her blood saber into him only 
            to realize that he's an immortal being. From then on, the two form 
            an impromptu friendship that revolves around Mirai constantly trying 
            to kill Akihito, in an effort to boost her own wavering confidence 
            as a Spirit World warrior. Eventually, Akihito also manages to 
            convince her to join the Literary Club, which houses two other 
            powerful Spirit World warriors, Hiroomi and Mitsuki Nase.
