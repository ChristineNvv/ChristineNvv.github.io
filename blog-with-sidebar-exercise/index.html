                    we all have a different gaming personality. Some like to 
                    complete a game perfectly, with no side-quest left 
                    unaccomplished, while some are destined to simply 
                    rage-quit everything. But how will you be playing Hogwarts 
                    Legacy?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can we guess your gaming personality? Oh, and this article 
                    will contain mild spoilers for the game, as you may imagine.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    If you have a lot of stresses in life… you’ll be a duelist
                </h3>

                    After a long day of mildly annoying things, sometimes you 
                    just want to sit down, grab a cup of tea, and …destroy 
                    everything. Well, good news! Hogwarts Legacy not only 
                    encourages your duelling skills, but also invites you to put 
                    them to the ultimate test in Battle Arenas. Although 
                    combining spells and using plants and potions strategically 
                    is encouraged, we won’t blame you if you just want to 
                    button-bash. And there will be plenty of big bosses for you 
                    to take out your frustrations on – although we hope you’re 
                    not afraid of giant spiders.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    If you’re a social butterfly… you’ll be talking to all the 
                    characters!
                </h3>

                    Less studying, more chit-chatting. That’s your motto. 
                    And we can hardly blame you. After so many years of 
                    dreaming of a game like this, we finally have the 
                    opportunity to live like a proper Hogwarts student, 
                    with so many classmates and professors dotted around the 
                    castle to socialise with. Of course you want to have a 
                    natter with everyone! And don’t forget about the portraits, 
                    house-elves and ghosts too – or Peeves the Poltergeist, 
                    who usually has a little poem for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And of course, you can go beyond Hogwarts to make friends 
                    too. We particularly like the travelling musician who likes 
                    to collect musical instruments – he’s quite the talent of 
                    the wizarding world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a big imagination… you’ll pick the dialogue 
                    options completely different to what you’d do in real life
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ooh, the temptation to pick the ‘mean’ options when you’re 
                    having a chat with someone in a game… and in Hogwarts 
                    Legacy, there are plenty of devilish dialogue choices that 
                    channel your inner Draco Malfoy rather than your inner 
                    Neville to choose from. So are you going to be nice or a bit 
                    nasty?
                </p>
                <h3>
                    If you love to travel… you’ll be exploring the Scottish 
                    Highlands
                </h3>

                    The designers of Hogwarts Legacy put a lot of love and care 
                    into the scenic Scottish highlands where Hogwarts is set. 
                    If all the Hogwarts classes are too much brain-energy for 
                    you, never fear. Just hop on your broom and traverse the 
                    gorgeous landscapes surrounding the castle. You’ll fly by 
                    many beautiful scenes, such as lakes, forestry and 
                    1800s-style hamlets. And as the seasons change with your 
                    gaming experience, you’ll get to explore the environments in 
                    all sorts of different weathers. We’ve all low-key dreamed 
                    of hanging out in a snowy Hogwarts, surely.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    If you’re a wholesome sort… you’ll be a cosy gamer in the 
                    Room of Requirement
                </h3>
                <img src="images/pic-4.jpeg" alr="video game cover">
                <p>
                    You probably grew up playing simulator-style games, where 
                    you get to generally potter (yep, we said it) about, 
                    tending to your gentle, daily tasks. Although Hogwarts 
                    Legacy has a big, epic storyline running through it – you 
                    also get the joy of simply getting to chill at Hogwarts. 
                    The Room of Requirement, in particular, is a space where 
                    you can just tinker, decorate, and build items. And then 
                    you have the Vivarium, which lets you look after cute 
                    magical creatures and create your own beautiful outdoor 
                    space. Who needs a storyline when you can just vibe?
