            <b>Graphic design</b> is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup>
            academic discipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup>
            and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives.
            <sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an 
            interdisciplinary branch of design
            <sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts. 
            Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking 
            using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and 
            graphics to communicate visually.

            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the 
            term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,
            <sup>[14]</sup> although it 
            appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
            <i>Organized Labor,</i> 
            a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an 
            article about technical education for printers:<sup>[15</sup>

            An Enterprising Trades Union
            …The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among 
            printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of 
            design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge 
            and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …

            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California 
            School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design 
            and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and 
            Lettering. Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.

        </p>
        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion 
            of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, 
            the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine 
            art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, 
            practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client. 
            In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and 
            services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to 
            information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts 
            that document the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively 
            recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. 
            Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic 
            design emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. Others 
            understand that it began to be identified as such by the late 19th 
            century.<sup>[11]</sup> 
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes 
            have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of 
            written language in the third millennium BCE. However, 
            the differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, 
            and required training are such that it is not possible to clearly 
            identify the current graphic designer with prehistoric man, 
            the 15th-century xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.
        </p>
        <p>
            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
            manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
            recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
            industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
            "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, 
            ergonomic, contextual, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
            profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
            social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.
            <sup>[18]</sup>
            Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout 
            history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to 
            manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and 
            book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic 
            design continued over the subsequent centuries, with composers or 
            typographers often designing pages according to established type.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
            profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
            specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
            technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
            Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation 
            of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its 
            actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 20th 
            centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines 
            hired art directors who organized all visual elements of 
            communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, 
            creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, 
            typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to 
            identify the emerging field.<sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers 
            continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial 
            possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, 
            and graphic designers created, among other things, magazine pages, 
            book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, 
            signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, 
            and websites. By the early 21st century, graphic design had become a 
            global profession as advanced technology and industry spread 
            worldwide.<sup>[11]</sup>

            In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to 
            print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist 
            scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. 
            Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books 
            were produced using movable type printing, making books widely 
            available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).<sup>[19]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg 
            developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using 
            movable type made with a new metal alloy
            <sup>[20]</sup> that created a 
            revolution in the dissemination of information.<sup>[21]</sup>

            In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design 
            education in Great Britain, informing the government of the 
            importance of design in his 
            <i>Journal of Design and Manufactures.</i> 
            He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern 
            industrial technology and Victorian design.

            From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader in 
            graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, 
            creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,
            [22] in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.[23] Morris' 
            work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly 
            influenced Art Nouveau.[24]

            Will H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in the 
            late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various Art 
            Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions 
            for a literary magazine titled The Chap-Book.[25]

            In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the 
            California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled 
            "Graphic Design and Lettering".[26] Raffe's Graphic Design, 
            published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" 
            in its title.[27] In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend 
            published his book titled "Graphic Design" and it is known to be 
            the first piece of literature to cover the topic extensively.[28]

            The signage in the London Underground is a classic design 
            example[29] of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic training, 
            Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. 
            The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a 
            design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the 
            name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif 
            letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of Edward 
            Johnston to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston 
            redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on 
            the blue bar in the center of a red circle.[30]

            In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual 
            production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw 
            individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus 
            moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. 
            They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, 
            clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.[31]

            Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 
            1928 book, New Typography.[32] He later repudiated the philosophy 
            he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.
            [citation needed] Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert 
            Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced 
            graphic design. They pioneered production techniques[citation 
            needed] and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth 
            century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern 
            style gain widespread acceptance and application.[33]
        </p>
        <p>
            The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with 
            consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from 
            within the graphic design community with the First Things First 
            manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was 
            re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in 
            the magazine Emigre 51[34] stating "We propose a reversal of 
            priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms 
            of communication – a mindshift away from product marketing and 
            toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. 
            The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is 
            running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives 
            expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of 
            design."[35]

            Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to 
            technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in 
            branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, 
            colors, packaging, labelling and text.

            From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of 
            opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful 
            compositions of visual information – known as information design. 
            With the advent of the web, information designers with experience 
            in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the 
            background to news stories. Information design can include Data and 
            information visualization, which involves using programs to 
            interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, 
            and can be tied in with information graphics.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights 
            the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and 
            by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. 
            The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs 
            which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; 
            communication as an agent.[citation needed]
