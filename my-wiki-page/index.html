                <h1>Hogwarts Legacy</h1>
                <p>
                    Hogwarts Legacy is a 2023 action role-playing game developed 
                    by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games 
                    under its Portkey Games label. The game is part of the 
                    Wizarding World franchise, taking place a century prior to 
                    the events chronicled in the Harry Potter novels. The player 
                    controls a student enrolled in the Hogwarts School of 
                    Witchcraft and Wizardry who learns to wield an array of 
                    magical abilities and objects. With the assistance of 
                    fellow students and professors, the protagonist embarks on 
                    a journey to unearth an ancient secret concealed within the 
                    wizarding world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following their acquisition by Warner Bros. in 2017, 
                    Hogwarts Legacy marks the first release from Avalanche 
                    unrelated to Disney Interactive Studios and its products. 
                    Development commenced in 2018, while pre-release gameplay 
                    footage was leaked onto the internet in the same year. 
                    The storyline was designed to take place in a period 
                    untouched by established Wizarding World characters, 
                    offering players the opportunity to immerse themselves in 
                    their own distinct universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game garnered significant anticipation upon announcement 
                    in 2020. Prior to its release, it attracted controversy due 
                    to Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling's views on transgender 
                    people and accusations of including antisemitic tropes, 
                    leading to calls for a boycott. Following some delays, it 
                    was released on 10 February 2023 for PlayStation 5, Windows, 
                    and Xbox Series X/S, on 5 May 2023 for PlayStation 4 and 
                    Xbox One, and on 14 November 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The 
                    early-access period of Hogwarts Legacy resulted in 
                    record-breaking viewership on streaming platform Twitch, 
                    making it the most-watched single-player game of all time on 
                    the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within two weeks of launch, the game sold more than 12
                    million copies and generated $850 million in global sales 
                    revenue. As of May 5, 2023, its revenue reached $1 billion, 
                    and by the beginning of 2024, global sales totaled 24 
                    million copies. Hogwarts Legacy received generally 
                    favourable reviews from critics, with praise for its combat, 
                    world design, characters, variety of content, and 
                    faithfulness to the source material, but criticism for its 
                    technical problems and lack of innovation as an open-world 
                    game.

                <p>
                    Hogwarts Legacy is an action role-playing game played from a 
                    third-person perspective. It is set at Hogwarts School of 
                    Witchcraft and Wizardry and its surrounding areas, 
                    influenced by the Wizarding World franchise.[1][2] During 
                    character creation, the player can choose their character's 
                    appearance, gender, voice, and body type. They may also 
                    choose one of the four Hogwarts Houses.[3] As players 
                    progress through the game, their player character learns to 
                    cast spells, brew potions, and master combat abilities, 
                    eventually developing their own special combat style.[4][5] 
                    Through in-game challenges, the player character can earn 
                    experience points to gain levels, which allows the player 
                    to access and upgrade different spells, talents, 
                    and abilities. These challenges come in the form of combat, 
                    quests, and exploration. Player characters can establish 
                    friendships with non-player characters (NPCs). As these 
                    relationships grow, schoolmates become companions who can 
                    accompany players on their journey, expand their abilities, 
                    and offer unique companion quests as players learn their 
                    stories.[6] Each of the four Hogwarts Houses—Gryffindor, 
                    Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin—also offers a unique 
                    common room; these rooms are only accessible for the 
                    player's current house chosen by the Sorting Hat.[7] 
                    Accompanied by the choice of house, the player receives 
                    different exclusive quests.[8] While house points for the 
                    four Hogwarts houses play a part in the game's plot, they 
                    are not influenced by player actions.[9]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next to experiences in Hogwarts Castle, the player can 
                    explore related areas such as the magic village of Hogsmeade, 
                    Forbidden Forest, or the Room of Requirement.[10] Hogsmeade 
                    features establishments such as The Three Broomsticks Inn, 
                    a gathering place for villagers and students; the Hog's 
                    Head, an inn with a less favourable reputation; and Zonko's, 
                    a store selling joke merchandise.[11] The Room of 
                    Requirement features environmental customisation elements; 
                    players can modify the room with multiple objects as they 
                    progress through the game. It can be entirely personalised, 
                    and its architecture can be changed. The room is used to 
                    place and take care of utility items such as brewing 
                    stations and planting pots, which can also be customised. 
                    Some of the magical beasts can be held in a chosen 
                    "Vivarium", a separate place where the player takes care of 
                    them.[10] Players will be able to tame, care for, and ride 
                    different magical beasts, including hippogriffs and 
                    thestrals. Other interactable magical creatures include u
                    nicorns, kneazles, and puffskeins.[12] Plants grown and 
                    acquired can be used in combat, such as mandrakes being 
                    used to stun enemies.[13] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the game features open-world gameplay, players are able 
                    to explore the map as they please. The different areas 
                    present various activities and enemies, with certain aspects 
                    locked behind progression milestones in the main plot. During 
                    exploration, players have the option to obtain gear by 
                    searching for treasure chests. The Revelio spell supports 
                    the player's exploration by acting as a scanning tool to 
                    discover secrets.[14] To travel around the map, players can 
                    choose between various options. Players may use Floo Powder 
                    to fast travel, or can fly across the map with a broom after 
                    participating in flying class.[15][16] Attending classes is 
                    one of the main elements of the game. Classes will be 
                    attended as a part of the story, advancing gameplay 
                    mechanics.[17] Progressing through the game causes the 
                    interior and exterior of the castle to change visually and 
                    match the seasons.[18]

                <p>
                    Hogwarts Legacy is set in the late 1800s, taking place in 
                    several Wizarding World locations such as Hogwarts Castle, 
                    Hogsmeade, and the Scottish Highlands.[1][10] The player 
                    takes on the role of a student (voiced by Sebastian Croft 
                    or Amelia Gething) starting their studies at Hogwarts in 
                    the fifth year.[19][20] The player character possesses the 
                    power to control a mysterious ancient magic and holds the 
                    key to an "ancient secret" that threatens the stability of 
                    the wizarding world. Their mission is to discover the 
                    reasons behind the resurgence of this forgotten magic and 
                    those who are trying to harness its power.[21]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player encounters various characters in the game, with 
                    the most relevant being their professors and fellow 
                    students. Professor Eleazar Fig, a wizard who teaches 
                    magic theory at Hogwarts, is a central ally throughout the 
                    player's adventure.[22][23] Other characters the protagonist 
                    meets include Hogwarts students Amit Thakkar (Asif Ali) and 
                    Everett Clopton (Luke Youngblood), Professors Onai 
                    (Kandace Caine) and Shah (Sohm Kapila), as well as 
                    headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black (Simon Pegg) and 
                    Professor Matilda Weasley (Lesley Nicol).[19] The 
                    protagonist is also able to build friendships with fellow 
                    students Natsai Onai, Poppy Sweeting, and Sebastian Sallow, 
                    who take part in the protagonist's journey as companion 
                    characters.[6] Antagonists featured in the game include 
                    Ranrok, the leader of a goblin rebellion, and Victor 
                    Rookwood, the leader of a group of Dark Wizards.[24]
                </p>
                <h4 id="link-4">Plot</h4>
                <p>
                    The protagonist receives a letter from Professor Weasley, 
                    which confirms their attendance at Hogwarts School of 
                    Witchcraft and Wizardry as a fifth-year student and assigns 
                    Professor Fig as the protagonist's mentor. Fig escorts the 
                    protagonist from London to Hogwarts via a flying coach. 
                    While investigating an unknown artefact, a dragon attacks 
                    them, prompting the two to reach for a Portkey hidden inside 
                    the artefact that teleports them to Gringotts. Using the 
                    Portkey to enter an old vault, the protagonist learns they 
                    can see traces of ancient magic. The duo is confronted by a 
                    hostile goblin named Ranrok before escaping to Hogwarts, 
                    where the protagonist is sorted into one of the four houses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The protagonist learns various spells during classes and 
                    goes on a trip to Hogsmeade with a companion, where a troll 
                    sent by Ranrok attacks them and is defeated by them. 
                    The protagonist also sneaks into the library and finds a 
                    book with missing pages. While Professor Fig studies 
                    the book, the protagonist locates the missing pages and 
                    finds a secret room below Hogwarts known as the Map 
                    Chamber, where they later visit several times with Fig and 
                    talk to the portraits of four deceased Hogwarts professors 
                    who refer to themselves as the "Keepers", whose goal is to 
                    protect the secrets of ancient magic from the wizarding 
                    world.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reveal the secrets of ancient magic, the protagonist 
                    completes four trials left by the Keepers. The trials 
                    feature complicated puzzles and dangerous tasks that 
                    require the skills the protagonist has acquired, each 
                    leading to a Pensieve, a magical device used to store and 
                    review memories. The protagonist learns from the memories 
                    that Isidora Morganach, a Hogwarts student who became a 
                    professor with abilities similar to the protagonist, was in 
                    conflict with the Keepers and left behind a hidden repository 
                    of ancient magic after using it to extract negative 
                    emotions, particularly from her suffering father. The 
                    Keepers realised that Isidora was inhaling the extracted 
                    emotions to increase her own power and failed to dissuade 
                    her, forcing one of them to eliminate her with the Killing 
                    Curse. Through their other adventures, the protagonist also 
                    learns that Ranrok, the leader of an ongoing goblin 
                    rebellion against wizards, seeks to find the repository and 
                    exploit it for his own ends. To locate it, he collaborates 
                    with a group of dark wizards led by Victor Rookwood, a 
                    descendant of one of the Keepers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the protagonist completes all trials, they receive one 
                    final task from the Keepers: to create a special type of 
                    magic wand from the artefacts found at the Pensieves. 
                    Professor Fig sends the protagonist to Gerbold Ollivander, 
                    the wandmaker, in order to craft the special wand. As the 
                    protagonist leaves Ollivander's, they are ambushed by 
                    Victor, who proposes an alliance against the goblins. 
                    The protagonist refuses, resulting in a battle in which 
                    the protagonist manages to defeat him. Shortly after, the 
                    protagonist and Professor Fig find the repository intact, 
                    and the protagonist makes their choice between keeping the 
                    magic sealed away or absorbing the power for themselves. 
                    Ranrok then locates Isidora's repository and absorbs the 
                    ancient power, transforming himself into a dragon. Fig is 
                    mortally wounded, and the protagonist battles the dragon,
